Open Media Library

== Install ==

 soon

== Networking ==

At this time you need a working IPv6 connection to use Open Media Libary.
If you dont have native IPv6 you can use Teredo/Miredo (apt-get install miredo)
or get a tunnel Hurricane Electric (https://tunnelbroker.net/)
or SixSS (https://sixxs.net).

== Platform ==

If you install Open Media Library on a architecture thats not directly supported,
you need a working python 2.7.x installation and the following packages:

 apt-get install \
    python-pypdf python-stdnum python-html5lib python-chardet python-openssl \
    python-simplejson python-lxml
 pip install -r requirements.txt

On Linux you need to always install:

 apt-get install \
    python-imaging  python-lxml ghostscript
